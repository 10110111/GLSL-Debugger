- streamRecording.h and streamRecording.c looks like hand-written but
  can be generated. There is ArgSizeFuncs.pl in generator/ which is
  probably template for this action. It must be checked and extended
  for full autogeneration.

- Optimisation. Debug lib takes too long to generate

- beginEndFunctionsTest is a tool to get functions allowed in begin-end blocks
  its output for some old videocards in generator/functions directory.
  The right way to do this is compile beginEndFunctionsTest, then run it to 
  get list of functions using user current videocard, and then pass it to
  compilation scripts. But this is not good variant for distro maintainers, so 
  other way is implement some scripting interface to pass this thing during the
  executing phase.
