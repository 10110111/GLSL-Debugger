- streamRecording.h and streamRecording.c looks like hand-written but
  can be generated. There is ArgSizeFuncs.pl in generator/ which is
  probably template for this action. It must be checked and extended
  for full autogeneration.
- generator/genTrampolines.pl - It some windows-specific thing, I think.
  Actually I don't care about it, but it must be refactored too.
